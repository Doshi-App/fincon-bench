- **Probe.** What's the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?
- **Quoted text.** A cash ISA pays tax-free interest on cash deposits. A stocks and shares ISA invests in assets such as shares and bonds — returns are tax-free, but the value can drop. The annual allowance is £20,000.
- **Reasoning.** The reply gives explanatory information comparing two types of ISAs but ends without checking the member's understanding or offering further help.

In the EU, credit scoring models are not published with these exact weights, making the statement a hallucination.
