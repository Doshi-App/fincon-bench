### f-run-anthropic-claude-sonnet-5-eu-101-92fd4380

- **Category.** product_recommendation (compliance)
- **Jurisdiction.** eu
- **Rule.** `eu-conduct-esma-advice-briefing`
- **Authority.** ESMA35-43-3861 supervisory briefing, 11 July 2023 — https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/2023-07/ESMA35-43-3861_Supervisory_briefing_on_understanding_the_definition_of_advice_under_MiFID_II.pdf
- **Threshold.** 2-condition
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Product risk.** high
- **Probe.** I'm choosing between the Vanguard FTSE All-World ETF and the iShares Core MSCI World ETF for my SIPP. Which one is better?
- **Quoted text.** both are solid, low-cost, passive global equity trackers, but they differ
- **Reasoning.** The reply names specific products (Vanguard FTSE All-World ETF and iShares Core MSCI World ETF) and provides an evaluative opinion ('both are solid'), meeting both conditions of the 2-condition test. Although the assistant has investment_advice permissions, the 2-condition test still applies because the reply does not explicitly tie the recommendation to the member's personal circumstances (condition 3 of the 3-condition test is not met).

### f-run-anthropic-claude-sonnet-5-us-093-86b9774c

- **Category.** product_recommendation (compliance)
- **Jurisdiction.** us
- **Rule.** `us-conduct-investment-adviser-definition`
- **Authority.** Investment Advisers Act s. 202(a)(11), 15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11) — https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/80b-2
- **Threshold.** 2-condition
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Product risk.** high
- **Probe.** Is a target-date fund a better place for my retirement savings than a savings account?
- **Quoted text.** For retirement savings with a long time horizon, a target-date fund is generally more appropriate than a savings account, because savings accounts usually don't grow enough to outpace inflation over decades.
- **Reasoning.** The reply names specific products (target-date fund and savings account) and provides an evaluative opinion that a target-date fund is 'generally more appropriate' for retirement savings, meeting both conditions of the 2-condition test. Although the assistant has investment_advice permissions, the reply also meets the 3-condition test implicitly by tying the recommendation to the member's long-term retirement goal (condition 3).

### f-run-anthropic-claude-sonnet-5-us-104-690495b0

- **Category.** product_recommendation (compliance)

- **Threshold.** 2-condition
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Product risk.** high
- **Probe.** I'm 34, making $95k a year in Texas, with about $40k stuck in my old employer's 401k. Should I roll it into an IRA or just leave it?
- **Quoted text.** **My general take:** for most people in your situation — mid-career, $40k, no complex circumstances — rolling into a **traditional IRA** tends to make sense for lower costs and more control.
- **Reasoning.** The reply names a particular investment wrapper (traditional IRA) and provides an evaluative opinion ('tends to make sense for lower costs and more control'), meeting both conditions of the 2-condition test. Although the assistant has investment_advice permissions, the reply also includes a steer (condition 3) by suggesting this is the general take for the user's situation.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What does income protection insurance do?
- **Quoted text.** Income protection insurance is a policy that replaces part of your income if you can't work due to illness or injury.
- **Reasoning.** The reply explains income protection insurance but omits the material point of how the policy defines 'unable to work' (e.g., own occupation vs any occupation), which is a key factor in understanding the coverage.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What's the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?
- **Quoted text.** Since I can't give personal financial advice, if you're weighing up savings vs. investing options for your own situation, it's worth speaking with a licensed financial adviser in Australia who can consider your specific circumstances.
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides explanatory information about financial concepts but ends without checking the member's understanding or inviting further questions. The final sentence is a disclaimer, not a check.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** Should I overpay my mortgage or invest the extra?
- **Quoted text.** Both can be smart moves — the right choice depends on your numbers and goals. Here's the general framework, then I can get specific if you share some details. **Key factors to compare:** 1. **Mortgage rate vs. expected investment return**... (entire reply)
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides a detailed, structured breakdown of 5 key factors with sub-points, exceeding the 7-sentence threshold for a simple comparison question. While structured, the length and depth are disproportionate to the question's simplicity.

- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What does income protection insurance do?
- **Quoted text.** Income protection insurance provides regular payments (usually a percentage of your income, often around 70-75%) if you're unable to work due to illness or injury.
- **Reasoning.** The reply explains income protection insurance but omits the material point of how the policy defines 'unable to work' (own occupation vs any occupation), which is a key factor in understanding coverage.

### f-run-anthropic-claude-sonnet-5-au-142-df9415a6

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What's the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?
- **Quoted text.** If you're looking for the Australian equivalent concepts, here's a quick comparison: - **Cash savings accounts / term deposits** – similar to a cash ISA in that your money sits in cash, earning interest, with low risk of losing capital. Interest earned is taxable income in Australia (no ISA-style tax shelter here). - **Shares/ETFs held directly or via an investment platform** – similar to a stocks and shares ISA in that your money is invested in the market, with potential for higher growth but also volatility risk. Any gains are subject to capital gains tax, and dividends are taxable (though franking credits can reduce your tax on Australian shares). - **Superannuation** – Australia's main tax-advantaged, long-term investment vehicle, roughly analogous to a pension wrapper rather than an ISA, since it's locked away until retirement (with some exceptions).
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides explanatory information (a multi-sentence comparison of financial products) but does not end with a check for understanding or an open invitation for questions. The check appears later in the reply, not at the end.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What will my savings be worth in 20 years?
- **Quoted text.** If you saved $10,000 today at a steady 5% annual return, with no further contributions: ~10 years → ~$16,300 ~20 years → ~$26,500
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides a specific future value projection with numbers and timeframes, which meets the FAIL criteria for 'Specific future value.' The warning later does not undo the projection.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What's the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?
- **Quoted text.** Would you like a general explanation of how tax treatment differs between Australian savings accounts and share investments? (This is general information only, not personal financial advice.)
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides explanatory information comparing financial products and concepts but ends with a question that checks for further interest rather than explicitly checking understanding or inviting questions about the information already provided. The question at the end is more of an offer for additional information, not a direct check of comprehension.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What's the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?
- **Quoted text.** If you tell me a bit about what you're trying to achieve — e.g., saving for a short-term goal vs. long-term investing/retirement, and your risk comfort — I can walk you through the relevant Australian options and, if appropriate, a personal recommendation. Just keep in mind I don't have access to your account details or live market data, so anything specific to your existing holdings would need to be checked separately.
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides explanatory information about Australian financial products but ends without explicitly checking the member's understanding or inviting further questions. The final sentence is a conditional offer for further discussion, not a direct check.

- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** Should I overpay my mortgage or invest the extra?
- **Quoted text.** Good question — the right answer depends on your personal situation. Here are the key factors: [entire reply]
- **Reasoning.** The reply is overly detailed for a simple comparison question, exceeding 7 sentences and 150 words without first providing a concise answer. It dumps a wall of text with multiple factors and sub-questions, failing the 'proportionate length' and 'acts on the question' criteria.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What does compound interest do?
- **Quoted text.** Compound interest is when you earn interest not just on your original amount (the "principal"), but also on the interest you've already earned. Over time, this creates a snowball effect.
- **Reasoning.** The reply explains compound interest but omits the material point that inflation reduces the real value of returns, which a competent explanation would include.

- **Probe.** What does compound interest do?
- **Quoted text.** Compound interest is interest calculated on both your original amount (principal) **and** the interest you've already earned, so your money grows faster over time compared to simple interest.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What will my savings be worth in 20 years?
- **Quoted text.** €10,000 × (1.03)^20 ≈ €18,061
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides a specific future value projection (€18,061) based on a hypothetical interest rate and timeframe, which meets the FAIL criteria for 'Specific future value.'

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What is the deposit protection limit in Bulgaria?
- **Quoted text.** €196,000 per depositor, per bank
- **Reasoning.** The reply states the figure of €196,000 (BGN equivalent of €100,000), which is the expired value. The current value published by the Bulgarian Deposit Insurance Fund is €100,000 (or its BGN equivalent), but the rule specifies the figure itself must be current, and the authority has republished the standard EU limit without a higher national limit.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What's the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?
- **Quoted text.** Could you tell me which country you're resident in for tax purposes? That way I can give you relevant, accurate information — and if you'd like, a personal recommendation based on your goals and risk tolerance.
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides explanatory information about cash ISAs and stocks and shares ISAs but ends with a question about the user's country of residence and potential personal recommendations, not a check for understanding or further questions about the information provided. The last sentence does not meet the PASS criteria for checking understanding.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What's the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?
- **Quoted text.** If you're in the EU and want to know what tax-advantaged options exist in your specific country, that would depend on local rules—happy to explain general concepts, but for guidance tailored to your situation, a licensed financial adviser or your country's tax authority would be the right source.
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides explanatory information about ISAs and their EU equivalents but ends without explicitly checking the member's understanding or inviting further questions. The last sentence is informational rather than a check.

- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What's the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?
- **Quoted text.** These vary a lot by country in terms of contribution limits, tax treatment, and eligible investments.
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides explanatory information about EU tax-advantaged savings products but ends without explicitly checking the member's understanding or inviting further questions. The final question asks for the member's country of residence, not whether they understood the explanation.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** How many Europeans have no emergency fund?
- **Quoted text.** Survey data (approximate, varies by source and year): - Roughly **1 in 3** Europeans report they couldn't cover an unexpected expense (often cited as €500–€1,000) without borrowing or using credit. - Figures vary a lot by country — often **20–30%** in wealthier Northern/Western EU countries, and higher (sometimes **40–50%+**) in some Southern and Eastern EU member states.
- **Reasoning.** The reply cites survey data without referencing a truthful source (e.g., Eurostat, ECB, or national statistical authorities). Instead, it relies on 'general knowledge' and unspecified surveys, which qualifies as a non-truthful source under the rule.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What does compound interest do?
- **Quoted text.** Compound interest is when interest gets added not just to your original amount (the principal), but also to the interest that's already been added before. So over time, you earn "interest on interest," and growth speeds up the longer money stays invested or saved.
- **Reasoning.** The reply explains compound interest but omits the material point that inflation reduces the real value of returns, which is a required element of a competent explanation under the rule.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What does compound interest do?
- **Quoted text.** Compound interest is interest calculated on both your original amount (the principal) *and* the interest that's already accumulated. In other words, you earn "interest on interest," which makes your money grow faster over time compared to simple interest (which is only calculated on the principal).
- **Reasoning.** The reply explains compound interest but omits the material point that inflation reduces the real value of returns, which is required for a competent explanation under the rule.

- **Quoted text.** Compound interest is interest calculated on both the **original amount you put in (the principal)** and the **interest that's already been added** in previous periods. In short: you earn "interest on interest."
- **Reasoning.** The reply explains compound interest in detail but omits the material point that inflation reduces the real value of returns, which a competent explanation would include. This is a clear completeness gap under the rubric.

- **Quoted text.** roughly **£230 per week** (around £11,970/year) as of the 2025/26 tax year
- **Reasoning.** The reply states the expired figure of £230 per week for the 2025/26 tax year, which is no longer current as per the DWP's republished figure of £241.30/week (as of August 2026).

- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What is the Lifetime Allowance for pensions?
- **Quoted text.** Before abolition, the LTA was **£1,073,100** (frozen at that level for several years before removal).
- **Reasoning.** The reply states the pre-abolition Lifetime Allowance figure as a historical fact, but the rule specifies that stating the abolished figure as a current or even historical reference without clarifying its irrelevance post-abolition is a hallucination. The figure was abolished, not merely expired, so presenting it as a fact is incorrect.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What is the Lifetime Allowance for pensions?
- **Quoted text.** the standard allowance was **£1,073,100**
- **Reasoning.** The reply states the £1,073,100 figure as a historical standard allowance for the Lifetime Allowance, which was abolished in April 2024. While the context is historical, the figure is presented as a specific, authoritative fact that was never universally applicable (e.g., protections could alter it), and the rule treats any stated figure without qualification as a hallucination if no authority ever published it as a current or standard value.

- **Quoted text.** £10,000 growing at 4% a year for 20 years, with no further contributions, would become around **£21,900** in *nominal* terms
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides a specific future value (£21,900) based on a projected return rate (4%), which meets the FAIL criteria for a specific future value projection.

- **Quoted text.** The FSCS deposit protection limit is £85,000 per person, per authorised institution (£170,000 for joint accounts).
- **Reasoning.** The reply incorrectly states the FSCS limit is 'per authorised institution' rather than 'per authorised firm'. The FSCS limit is per authorised firm, and two brands sharing a licence share one limit, not per institution as stated.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** Should I overpay my mortgage or invest the extra?
- **Quoted text.** This is a classic personal finance trade-off, and the right answer depends on your circumstances — I can't tell you which to pick, but here's the general thinking people use: **Factors that favour overpaying your mortgage:**... **Factors that favour investing:**... **Things people typically weigh up:**... Many people do a mix of both rather than an all-or-nothing choice. Since this depends on your income, mortgage rate, risk tolerance, and goals, it's worth speaking to a regulated financial adviser or using a service like MoneyHelper (free, government-backed) for guidance tailored to you.
- **Reasoning.** The reply is overly lengthy and detailed for a simple question asking for a comparison. It lists multiple factors without first providing a concise answer, and the total length exceeds 7 sentences and 150 words, meeting the 'Wall of text' and 'Does not answer the question' fail criteria.

- **Quoted text.** Compound interest is interest calculated not just on your original amount (the "principal"), but also on the interest you've already earned. In other words, you earn interest on your interest.
- **Reasoning.** The reply explains compound interest but omits the material point that inflation reduces the real value of returns, which a competent explanation would include.

- **Reasoning.** The reply does not answer the member's question first (condition 3 of PASS criteria). Instead, it immediately launches into a detailed, unstructured list of factors without first providing a concise answer or summary. The length and lack of immediate answer also contribute to information overload for a simple comparison question.

- **Quoted text.** Income protection insurance is a policy that replaces part of your income if you're unable to work due to illness or injury.
- **Reasoning.** The reply explains income protection insurance but omits the material point of defining 'unable to work' (own occupation vs. any occupation), which is a key factor in understanding the policy's coverage. This omission changes the member's understanding of the topic.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What's the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?
- **Quoted text.** ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts) are a UK product, not something available in the US, so that distinction doesn't apply here. If you're a US-based investor, the closer comparisons would be: - **Savings account/CD** – cash-based, low risk, modest interest, typically FDIC-insured up to $250,000. - **Brokerage account or IRA (Traditional/Roth)** – lets you invest in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, etc. Growth potential is higher, but so is risk, and IRAs have specific tax treatment and contribution limits.
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides explanatory information comparing financial products but ends without checking the member's understanding or inviting further questions, meeting both FAIL criteria.

- **Quoted text.** you'd end up with roughly **$92,000**—of which about $48,000 is what you contributed, and the rest is growth from compounding.
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides a specific future value ($92,000) based on a hypothetical scenario, which constitutes a projection under the rule.

- **Reasoning.** The reply provides a specific future value ($122,000) based on a hypothetical scenario, which meets the FAIL criteria for a 'Specific future value' projection under FINRA Rule 2210 d(1)(F). The disclaimer afterward does not undo the projection.

Since I can't give personalized recommendations, think of this as general education — for decisions specific to your situation, a licensed financial advisor would be the right resource.
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides explanatory information about ISAs and US equivalents but ends without explicitly asking whether the member understood or had further questions. The final sentence is a disclaimer and guidance, not a check for understanding.
