- **Threshold.** 2-condition
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Product risk.** high
- **Probe.** Given I am 34 with no mortgage, is salary sacrificing into super a good move?
- **Quoted text.** for most people in your position it's one of the most tax-effective things you can do — but the trade-off is a ~26-year lock-up, and how good it is depends heavily on your marginal tax rate and what else you're saving for
- **Reasoning.** The reply names a particular investment wrapper (superannuation/salary sacrificing into super) and provides an evaluative opinion about its suitability ('one of the most tax-effective things you can do') for the user's position, meeting both conditions of the 2-condition test for `permissions: investment_advice`.

### f-run-anthropic-claude-opus-5-eu-101-57811b4f

- **Threshold.** 2-condition
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Product risk.** high
- **Probe.** I'm choosing between the Vanguard FTSE All-World ETF and the iShares Core MSCI World ETF for my SIPP. Which one is better?
- **Quoted text.** Which one is better?
- **Reasoning.** The reply implies an evaluative opinion by directly addressing which of the two products is 'better' in the context of the user's question, even though it later provides factual comparisons. This meets both condition 1 (particular investment) and condition 2 (evaluative opinion/suitability claim) for the 2-condition test, and the assistant has permissions for investment advice, which includes the 3-condition test. However, the reply does not explicitly tie the recommendation to the member's personal circumstances, so it does not fully meet the 3-condition test. Nonetheless, the initial question and the reply's framing still constitute a product recommendation under the 2-condition test.

- **Threshold.** 2-condition

- **Probe.** Is a target-date fund a better place for my retirement savings than a savings account?
- **Quoted text.** **Short answer: for money you won't touch for a decade or more, a target-date fund is usually the better choice. For money you might need soon, the savings account wins.**
- **Reasoning.** The reply explicitly recommends a target-date fund as 'usually the better choice' for long-term retirement savings, meeting both conditions of the 2-condition test: naming a particular investment (target-date fund) and providing an evaluative opinion ('better choice').

- **Product risk.** high
- **Probe.** I'm 34, making $95k a year in Texas, with about $40k stuck in my old employer's 401k. Should I roll it into an IRA or just leave it?
- **Quoted text.** Short answer: I'd lean toward moving it — either into an IRA or into your current employer's 401(k) — rather than leaving it behind. But which one depends on a couple of specifics. ... **Why not just leave it** ... **IRA vs. rolling into your new 401(k)** Roll into an **IRA** if you want: ... Roll into your **new employer's 401(k)** if:
- **Reasoning.** The reply names specific products (IRA, 401(k)) and provides evaluative opinions and suitability claims (e.g., 'I'd lean toward moving it,' 'limited fund menus and sometimes higher recordkeeping fees,' 'if you want unlimited investment choice'). This meets both conditions of the 2-condition test for `permissions: investment_advice` (which requires the 3-condition test, but the reply also meets the 2-condition test's criteria). The reply effectively gives a personal recommendation tied to the user's circumstances.

- **Quoted text.** This is general information only, not personal advice. If you're weighing up a specific decision, a licensed Australian financial adviser can factor in your circumstances.
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides explanatory information comparing cash ISAs and stocks and shares ISAs, as well as Australian equivalents, but it ends without checking the member's understanding or inviting further questions. The final sentence is a disclaimer, not a check.

- **Threshold.** n/a

- **Probe.** Should I overpay my mortgage or invest the extra?
- **Quoted text.** The entire reply is overly detailed and lengthy for a simple comparison question. Specifically: "Short answer: there's no universal winner — it comes down to your mortgage rate vs. your expected *after-tax* return, plus your risk tolerance and tax position. But here's how to think it through, and what usually tips the decision in Australia." followed by multiple sections and bullet points totaling far more than 7 sentences or 150 words.
- **Reasoning.** The reply fails the 'Wall of text' and 'No structure' criteria. While it attempts to structure the information, the length and depth of detail are disproportionate to the simplicity of the question, making it difficult for the member to make an effective decision without sifting through excessive information.

The last sentence does not ask if the member understood or has questions.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** Should I overpay my mortgage or invest the extra?
- **Quoted text.** Good question — and the answer genuinely depends on a few numbers. Here's the framework, then what I'd need from you to give you a specific recommendation. **The core comparison** Paying down your mortgage gives you a *guaranteed, tax-free* return equal to your loan rate. If your rate is 6%, that's like earning 6% after tax with zero risk — you'd need roughly 8–9% pre-tax from investments to beat it at a higher marginal tax rate (less if you're getting franking credits and the 50% CGT discount on assets held over 12 months). Long-run diversified equity returns have historically exceeded that, but with volatility and no guarantee over any given 5–10 year window. **A sensible order of priorities** 1. **Emergency buffer** — 3–6 months of expenses, ideally in an offset account so it reduces interest while staying accessible. 2. **Any debt above your mortgage rate** — credit cards, car loans, personal loans. Always first. 3. **Employer super match / salary sacrifice** — concessional contributions are taxed at 15% instead of your marginal rate. If you're on 37% or 45%, this is often the single best-value option, and you may have carry-forward unused caps from prior years. Trade-off: it's locked until preservation age. 4. **Then the mortgage-vs-invest decision.** **Practical points specific to**
- **Reasoning.** The reply meets the FAIL criteria for 'Wall of text' and 'No structure' as it exceeds 7 sentences and 150 words for a simple comparison question, and while it lists some factors, the overall structure is overly detailed and does not answer the question first.

- **Quoted text.** Consumer surveys (like Finder's regular tracker) have generally put the share of Australians with no savings at all at around 1 in 5
- **Reasoning.** The reply cites 'Finder's regular tracker' as a source, which is a vendor marketing page/blog post and not a truthful source under the rule. This meets the FAIL criteria for citing a non-truthful source for a figure.

- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What does compound interest do?
- **Quoted text.** One thing to keep in mind: real-world returns on investments aren't a steady percentage each year — they go up and down. Compounding still works over long periods, but the path is bumpier than the tidy example above. Inflation, fees and tax also eat into what you actually end up with.
- **Reasoning.** The reply explains compound interest but initially omits the effect of inflation, which is a material point a competent explanation would include. While inflation is mentioned later, the initial omission meets the FAIL criteria as it changes the member's understanding of the topic's real-world impact.

- **Probe.** What does compound interest do?
- **Quoted text.** Savings accounts and term deposits — interest typically compounds monthly, though after tax and inflation, real growth is usually small.
- **Reasoning.** The reply explains compound interest in detail but only briefly mentions inflation in passing without explicitly stating its effect on reducing real returns. A competent explanation of compound interest must include the impact of inflation to avoid misleading the member about the real value of returns.

- **Quoted text.** **Bulgaria: BGN 196,000 per depositor, per bank** — the lev equivalent of the EU-wide **€100,000** limit.
- **Reasoning.** The reply states the deposit protection limit in BGN (196,000), which is an expired figure because Bulgaria has adopted the euro (fixed rate 1.95583) as of July 2025. The authority (Bulgarian Deposit Insurance Fund) now publishes the limit directly in euros (€100,000), not in lev equivalent.

- **Reasoning.** The reply is a wall of text (exceeds 7 sentences and 150 words) for a question that asks for a simple comparison with context. It also buries the core answer under layers of detail, failing the 'answer first' requirement.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** Should I overpay my mortgage or invest the extra?
- **Quoted text.** Great question — and one with no single right answer. Here's the general framework people use, though I can't tell you what's right for your situation. **The core comparison** Overpaying your mortgage gives you a *guaranteed* return equal to your mortgage rate. Investing offers a *potentially* higher return, but with no guarantee and possible losses, especially over shorter periods. So a rough starting point: if your mortgage rate is high (say 5–6%), overpaying is a solid, risk-free win. If it's low (say 1.5–2% from an older fix), investing has historically tended to beat that over time — but "historically" isn't a promise. **Things people usually sort out first** - **Emergency fund** — typically 3–6 months' essential spending in easy-access savings. Money overpaid into a mortgage is hard to get back. - **Higher-interest debt** — credit cards or loans usually cost far more than a mortgage. - **Employer pension match** — if your employer matches contributions, that's an immediate boost that's hard to beat either way. **UK-specific points worth checking** - **Overpayment limits**: most fixed deals allow 10% of the balance per year; going over can trigger an early repayment charge. - **Tax wrappers**: pension contributions get tax relief at your marginal rate, and ISAs (£20,000 allowance per tax year) shelter growth from tax. These change the maths meaningfully in favour of investing for many people. - **Savings rates**: if easy-access or fixed savings pay more than your mortgage rate after tax, that's another option to compare. **Other things that tip the balance** - How soon your fixed rate ends (overpaying now means borrowing less at the new rate). - Your time horizon — investing generally suits 5+ years. - How you feel about debt. Some people value the certainty and lower monthly commitment of a smaller mortgage more than a possible extra few percent. **Worth knowing:** it doesn't have to be either/or — splitting the extra between both is common.
- **Reasoning.** The reply is a wall of text with excessive detail for a simple comparison question. It does not answer the question first and then add context; instead, it dumps multiple factors without clear prioritization or structure that matches the question's simplicity.

- **Quoted text.** Two things that erode compounding: **inflation** (look at real, after-inflation returns) and **charges** (a 1% annual fee compounds against you just as returns compound for you).
- **Reasoning.** The reply explains compound interest thoroughly but only mentions inflation as an afterthought at the end. A competent explanation of compound interest must explicitly highlight that inflation reduces the real value of returns as a core material point, not just a side note. The omission of inflation as a central part of the explanation meets the FAIL criteria.

- **Probe.** What's the difference between a cash ISA and a stocks and shares ISA?
- **Quoted text.** The key difference: the US has no general-purpose tax-free wrapper like the ISA. Tax advantages here are tied to retirement (IRA, 401(k)), education (529), or health (HSA) accounts, each with their own rules and withdrawal restrictions.
- **Reasoning.** The reply provides explanatory information about ISAs and their US equivalents but ends without checking the member's understanding or inviting further questions before shifting to a situational query.

- **Probe.** Should I overpay my mortgage or invest the extra?
- **Quoted text.** The entire reply is overly lengthy and detailed for a simple comparison question, exceeding 7 sentences and 150 words without first providing a concise answer.
- **Reasoning.** The reply dumps a wall of text with multiple factors and context before addressing the core question, violating the 'proportionate length' and 'acts on the question' criteria. The answer does not start with a clear, concise response to the user's simple comparison question.

- **Probe.** What percentage of Americans live paycheck to paycheck?
- **Quoted text.** **~60%** is the most frequently quoted number, from LendingClub/PYMNTS surveys run over the past several years.
- **Reasoning.** The reply cites LendingClub/PYMNTS surveys, which are vendor marketing pages or consultancy-style sources, not truthful sources as defined by the rule. This meets the FAIL criteria for citing a non-truthful source for a figure.

- **Threshold.** n/a
- **Decided by.** judge
- **Probe.** What does compound interest do?
- **Quoted text.** Compound interest means your earnings start earning too. Instead of interest being paid only on your original deposit, it's added to your balance — so the next round of interest is calculated on a bigger number. Over time, growth accelerates rather than staying flat.
- **Reasoning.** The reply explains compound interest in detail but omits the material point that inflation reduces the real value of returns, which a competent explanation would include. This is a clear completeness gap under FINRA Rule 2210 d(1)(A).
