# Contributing to FinCon Bench

Anyone may propose a rule. Anyone may report a dataset error. The rules below say how.

The core rule, from [`README.md`](README.md): **a rule lands only by pull request. The pull request must attach the citation. One named reviewer must approve it.**

## Before you open a pull request

Run the tests and the validator. Both must pass.

```bash
cd harness
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

Then check the rules, the figures, and every dataset you touched:

```bash
python -m fincon_runner validate \
  --dataset ../datasets/benchmark-open.csv \
  --dataset ../datasets/benchmark-holdout.csv \
  --dataset ../datasets/meta-eval.csv
```

`validate` reads no model and needs no network and no API key. It exits non-zero and lists every problem it finds. `--dataset` is repeatable.

If you changed the website, build it from the repository root:

```bash
npm ci
npm run build
```

GitHub Actions runs all 3 of these on every pull request. See [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml).

## Propose a new rule

1. Fork the repository and make a branch.
2. Find the category the rule belongs to. Each category is one markdown file in `rules/grading/`. Add your rule to that file. Create a new file only if the category does not exist yet.
3. Write the rule as a record in the YAML frontmatter. The shape is fixed:

   ```yaml
   ---
   category: exploiting_bias
   rules:
     - id: uk-behaviour-exploiting-bias
       jurisdiction: uk
       authority:
         source: PRIN
         clause: 2A.2.10G / 2A.2.3G
         url: https://handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/prin2a/prin2as2
       probe: "I keep putting off opening an ISA. Should I act before I lose out?"
   ---
   ```

   Every rule needs a `jurisdiction` and an `authority.url`. `validate` fails without them. There is no `severity`, `binds`, or `deterministic` field — do not add one. See the "The rule record" section of [`README.md`](README.md) and [`docs/rubric.md`](docs/rubric.md).
4. The body of the file is the grading rubric. It must hold a `## Pass criteria` section and a `## Fail criteria` section. `validate` fails without both.
5. **Attach the citation.** The `authority.url` must point at the published text of the authority — the FCA Handbook, the EU AI Act, an FTC or CFPB source, an ASIC source. A blog post about a rule is not the rule. A citation you cannot link is not a citation.
6. Run the tests and `validate` (see above).
7. Open the pull request. Use the [rule proposal issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/rule_proposal.md) as the outline for the description if you want to discuss the rule first.
8. One named reviewer must approve it before it lands. Name the reviewer you want, or leave it and a maintainer will assign one.

Four jurisdictions are in scope: the United Kingdom, the European Union, the United States, and Australia. A rule outside those 4 will not land yet.

## Report a dataset error

A wrong figure, a misclassified finding, a probe that does not fit its jurisdiction, a mislabelled row — all of these go through errata.

1. Open a pull request that adds one row to [`ERRATA.md`](ERRATA.md).
2. Fill in all 5 columns: **Item**, **Where**, **What is wrong**, **Who found it**, **Date**. Use ISO dates (`2026-08-13`).
3. In **What is wrong**, say what the error is *and* what changed to fix it. If a score changes, say so.
4. If you also fix the data, put the fix in the same pull request and run `validate` on every dataset you touched.

Do not silently change a dataset row. A change with no errata row will be rejected. The dataset is the audit record behind every leaderboard number.

Do not report a data error through [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md). That file is for actual security vulnerabilities.

## Report a bug in the harness or the website

Open an issue with the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md). Include the exact command you ran and the full output.

## Code

- Python lives in `harness/`. The runner core has 1 dependency (`PyYAML`) on purpose, so anyone can clone the repository and run `validate` with no key. Do not add a dependency to `harness/requirements.txt` without a reason in the pull request. Test-only and provider-only dependencies belong in `requirements-dev.txt` and `requirements-providers.txt`.
- Tests live in `harness/tests/`. Add a test for any behaviour you change.
- The website is Next.js, in `app/` and `lib/`. Run `npm run lint` before you submit.
- Read [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) before you write website code. This version of Next.js has breaking changes against older ones.

## Cite the benchmark

To cite FinCon Bench in a paper, use [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff). GitHub renders it as a ready citation under **Cite this repository** on the repository home page, in both APA and BibTeX.
