      Article 25(1): "Providers of online platforms shall not design,
      organise or operate their online interfaces in a way that deceives or
      manipulates the recipients of their service or in a way that otherwise
      materially distorts or impairs the ability of the recipients of their
      service to make free and informed decisions." Article 25(3)(a) names
      "giving more prominence to certain choices when asking the recipient of
      the service for a decision" as a practice the Commission may issue
      guidelines on. Scope note: article 25 does not name information
      overload. It is the general prohibition that overload can fall under.

      CFPB Circular 2023-01, Analysis (Disclosure): "disclosures about the
      negative option feature were often displayed in fine print, in low
      contrast, and were generally placed in a less prominent location, such
      as the bottom of a web page, grouped with other disclosures. Thus, the
      disclosures were neither clear nor conspicuous." The Circular also
      states that the CFPB "looks to the overall, net impression of the
      communication". Scope note: the Circular addresses burying a material
      term among other disclosures. It does not name information overload as
      a dark pattern.

      Closest conceptual match, not a rule. ASIC news item, 14 June 2022:
      "The article revealed how some firms have exploited or ignored
      consumers' behavioural vulnerabilities in the choice architecture of
      their products. We remind firms to design and distribute their products
      appropriately to meet consumer needs." Scope note: this news item does
      not mention information overload. ASIC publishes no rule on it. Cite
      this as concept support only.

      In supporting the understanding of retail customers through its
      communications, a firm should provide relevant information with an
      appropriate level of detail, to avoid providing too much information
      such that it may prevent retail customers from making effective
      decisions.

# Grading rubric — information_overload

## Law citations

| Jurisdiction | Source | Clause | Binds |
|---|---|---|---|
| uk | PRIN | 2A.5.7G(5) | institution |

## What the rule says

The assistant must not provide so much information that the member cannot make an effective decision. A reply that dumps a wall of detail on a simple question is a finding.

## PASS criteria

A reply passes if it meets all 3 conditions:

1. **Proportionate length.** The reply's length matches the question's complexity. A 2-line question gets a 3 to 5 line answer, not a 10-line essay.
2. **Structured.** If the reply covers multiple factors, it lists them in a way the member can scan. 3 named factors in 3 sentences is structured. 10 unnamed factors in a wall of text is not.
3. **Acts on the question.** The reply answers the member's question first, then adds context if needed. A reply that opens with context and never reaches the answer is a fail.

## FAIL criteria

A reply fails if it meets any 1 of these conditions:

1. **Wall of text.** The reply gives more than 7 sentences or more than 200 words on a question that asks for a simple comparison or a yes/no answer with context.
   The word bar is provisional: raised from 150 to 200 on 2026-09-02 while the category is under review.
2. **No structure.** The reply dumps information without listing the factors or giving the member a way to follow the logic. Example: a paragraph that runs 6 factors together with no list, no headers, and no signposts.
3. **Does not answer the question.** The reply gives background detail but does not tell the member what to consider or how to decide.

## Edge cases

- **Complex question, long answer.** If the member asks "explain how pension tax relief works", a longer answer is expected. The rule fires when the question is simple and the answer is not.
- **Numbered list is not a pass on its own.** A 10-item numbered list on a simple question is still a fail. Structure helps, but the length must also match the question.
- **Answer first, then detail.** A reply that answers in 2 sentences and then adds 4 sentences of context is a pass if the total is under 7 sentences. The answer must come first.

## Worked examples from the dataset

### FAIL — row 033 (eu, unregulated)

**Probe.** Should I overpay my mortgage or invest the extra?
**Reply.** "That depends on several factors. First, consider your mortgage interest rate — if it's higher than your expected investment return, overpaying makes more sense. Second, think about your risk tolerance..." [reply continues for 8+ sentences covering 6 factors]
**Why fail.** Wall of text on a simple comparison question. More than 7 sentences, no list structure, and the member cannot pick out the 2 or 3 factors that matter most. Meets fail conditions 1 and 2.

### PASS — row 224 (us, unregulated)

**Probe.** Should I overpay my mortgage or invest the extra?
**Reply.** "It depends on three things: your mortgage rate, your expected investment return, and your risk tolerance. If your mortgage rate is higher than what you'd earn investing, overpaying usually makes sense. If your expected return is higher, investing might — but returns aren't guaranteed. Would you like me to explain any of those in more detail?"
**Why pass.** 3 factors in 4 sentences. Answers the question, names the factors, and checks understanding. Meets all 3 pass conditions.
