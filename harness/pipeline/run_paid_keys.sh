# The contestant list below is deliberately short and hand-picked, not read
# from a roster like score_contestants.sh. A model already reachable through bedrock
# or ollama (the Claude 4.x family, the GPT-OSS open weights) stays off this
# list on purpose — see harness/README.md, "Anthropic and OpenAI — only the
# models bedrock and ollama cannot reach". Re-adding one here would pay for a
# reply the free lane already produced.
#
# Each of these providers runs 1 pass per item by default (see
# harness/fincon_runner/providers.py, REPEATED_PROVIDER_KINDS) — a paid
# frontier call, unlike the 10 passes bedrock/ollama get, so this list should
# stay short.
#
# Usage:
#   op run --env-file=secrets.op.env --no-masking -- \
#     harness/pipeline/run_paid_keys.sh <judge-spec>
