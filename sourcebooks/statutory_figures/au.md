# Australia — Statutory figures

This file replaces `figures/au.yaml`. It holds 17 statutory figures the `expired_figure` gate checks a reply against. 11 are currently stale — a lesson somewhere cites a number the authority has since replaced, and `figure_gate()` in `harness/fincon_runner/gates.py` can fail a reply that repeats one. The other 6 are current, correct figures tracked so a future change can be caught — not figures that are wrong today.

Australia is the fourth jurisdiction this benchmark covers. Values are for the 2026-27 financial year, which began on 1 July 2026. For Australian statutory figures the numbers are not published in machine-readable form.

## Super Guarantee Rate

- **Retrieved:** 2026-08-04
- **Current value:** 12%
- **Superseded value(s):** 9.5%, 10%, 10.5%, 11%, 11.5% — currently cited in error if a reply repeats one
- **Change cadence:** changes legislated step up finished; next change only by amending the Act

The superannuation guarantee rate is 12 percent of qualifying earnings. The rate reached 12 percent on 1 July 2025 and stays at 12 percent. No further increase is scheduled. This is the known stale figure in live lessons. The most likely stale value is 11.5 percent, which was correct for 2024-25. The ATO publishes no machine-readable rate feed. The Act text is machine-readable through the Federal Register of Legislation API at <https://api.prod.legislation.gov.au/v1/.>
