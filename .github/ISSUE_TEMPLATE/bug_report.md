<!--
A wrong figure, a mislabelled row, or a misclassified finding is NOT a bug.
That is a dataset error. Open a pull request that adds a row to ERRATA.md
instead. See CONTRIBUTING.md.

A security vulnerability is NOT a bug report. See SECURITY.md.
-->

## Where

- [ ] Harness (`harness/`)
- [ ] Website (`app/`, `lib/`)

`python -m fincon_runner validate --dataset ../datasets/benchmark-open.csv`
pass? Say so either way. -->
